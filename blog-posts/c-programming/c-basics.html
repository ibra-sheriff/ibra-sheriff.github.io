            <p>
                To code you will need a text editor(or IDE) and a compiler like <strong>gcc</strong> to compile your C files. In terms of development tools I would say consider one of these:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">Vim</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-notepad/9MSMLRH6LZF3?hl=en-us&gl=us">Notepad</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I would go with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, it's available on Windows, Mac Linux. If you want something that may require less to think about consider <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>, this is a full C programming IDE.
                <br><br>
                To install <strong>gcc</strong> on Linux check out this <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/">article</a>, the critical line to run as you will see in the article is, <code>sudo apt install build-essential</code>
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Hello, World!</h2>
            <p>
                <code>
                    1 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
                    2 <br>   
                    3 int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { <br>
                    4 &nbsp; &nbsp; printf("Hello, World!\n"); <br>
                    5 }
                </code>
                <br>
                Above is your first C program. We start by inputting the Standard I/O(Input and Output) library so that you can use the <code>printf</code> function to display something on the screen.
                <br><br>
                After we compile the program using the command: <code>gcc -o hello hello.c</code>, we run it the executable generated by the compilation process as follows: <code>./hello</code>. C will look for a function called <code>main</code> to begin execution of the program, this is the where the program starts running line by line, so it is important to always define a <code>main</code> function.
                <br><br>
                Now that C has identified the <code>main</code> function it executes line 5 which prints the words "Hello, World!" on the create. Note we use <code>\n</code> to put a new line after printing the words. 
                <br><br>
                Before moving on I would like to say watch your semicolons(;)! Each statement in C ends with a semicolon(;), leaving out semicolons is a leading cause of error for C novices.

                    17 &nbsp;&nbsp; printf("a %% b = %d\n", a_modulus_b); <br>
                    18 } <br>
                </code>
                Let the fun begin, in this section we will see how we can use C as our favourite calculator to do basic arithmetic operations.
                <br><br>
                We start in line 4 by <strong>declaring</strong> the integer(<code>int</code>) variable <code>a</code> and <strong>assign</strong> it the value 1. Note we can declare first i.e. <code>int a;</code> and assign later in another line <code>a = 1;</code>, as long as we ensure we have assigned a value to <code>a</code> before we use it.
                <br><br>After declaring <code>b</code> and assigning it the value 1 we move onto to lines 7 to 11 where we declare new variables which hold the results of applying arithmetic operations on <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Let's take a look at our operators:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Addition</strong>: we use <code>+</code></li>
                <li><strong>Subtraction</strong>: we use <code>-</code></li>
                <li><strong>Multiplication</strong>: we use <code>*</code></li>
                <li><strong>Division</strong>: we use <code>/</code></li>
                <li><strong>Modulus</strong>: we use <code>%</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After applying our operators and storing the results in new variables e.g. <code>a_plus_b</code> stores the sum of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> we print the results on the screen. It is important to note that in C when printing a variable we use %(variable type letter) and then provide the variable as a parameters to the <code>printf</code> function. For integers we use <code>%d</code>.
                <br><br>
                Also note to print % on the screen we have to write it twice. This is because %d serves an important purpose so we have to "escape" it and tell C we actually want it to print a % not to print a variable.
                <br><br>
                A question you may have is what is modulus? If you have no seen this before then the best way to understand it is that modulus relates to remainder, so 1 divided 1 leaves no remainder but if we had 5 modulues 2 the remainder would be 1 as 2 goes into 5 twice(\(2 \times 2 = 4\)) leaving 1.

            <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Casting</h2>
            <p>
                In most cases this topic is only relevant when working with doubles and integers. Since these types both relate to numeric types you can convert between the two, for example:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    1 int a = 5;<br>
                    2 double b = (double) a;
                    3 <br>
                    4 int c = 10;<br>
                    5 double d = (double) a / (double) c;<br>
                    6 int e = (int) (c / b);<br>
                </code>
                <br>
                We cast by putting the desired type in front of the variable we want to cast to another type. This is very useful when we want to divide integers get the decimal result, for example above we want the value of 
                <code>d</code> to be 0.5 not 0. It will be zero because when we divide integers and get a result that is not a whole number C will truncate the decimal part to leave the whole number, so a number like 9.75 will become 
                9 not 10 as we see when we do rounding. Make sure you watch out for this! It causes bugs in a lot of programs where mathematical precision is key.
                <br>
                Sometimes truncation is desired like in floor calculations in mathematics, then converting from double to integer like seen in line 6 is very useful.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Define Constants in C</h2>
            <p>
                The #define directive allows the definition of macros within your source code. You can use to define constants, variables that must hold values that do not change. You can use this to store values related to 
                array sizes, dimensions and locations, values that never change. For example, the value of \(\pi \) nevers changes, this is an example of a value that we could store in a constant. You can define your constants 
                after including your Header files. For example:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    1 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
                    2 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; <br>
                    3 <br>
                    4 #define BOARD_HEIGHT 4 <br>
                    5 #define BOARD_WIDTH 5 <br>
                    6 <br>
                    7 int main() { <br>
                    8 &nbsp;&nbsp; int area = BOARD_HEIGHT * BOARD_WIDTH;<br>
                    9 &nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Area = %d", area);<br>
                    10&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;<br>
                    11}
                </code>
                <br><br>
                Here we have the dimensions of rectangle for a game board stored using the variables <code>BOARD_HEIGHT</code> and <code>BOARD_WIDTH</code> defined using macro definitions. It is important that we can only access the 
                values of these variables, we cannot actually change them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Commenting in C</h2>
            <p>
                As programmers we find that is is useful to make notes of what our code does, report bugs or remind ourselves to do something. We use <strong>comments</strong> to do this and in C we have the following two options:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inline Comments</strong> - <code>// this is a comment</code></li>
                <li><strong>Multiline Comments</strong> - <code>/* this is a comment */</code></li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Inline Comments</strong> are used when we want to write a comment on a single line while <strong>Multiline Comments</strong> when we want to write a long code over multiple lines. Let's see these comments in use in our Hello, World program:
            <p>
                <br>
                <code>
                    1 // import the Standard I/O library <br>
                    2 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
                    3 <br>
                    4 /* <br>
                    5 This program prints the words Hello, World on the screen for the user. <br>
                    6 See how this comment to continue over multiple lines! <br>
                    7 */ <br>
                    8 int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { <br>
                    9 &nbsp; &nbsp; printf("Hello, World!\n"); <br>
                    10 }
                </code>
                <br><br>
                Ensure to use comments to document your code, it's so easy to forget what a piece of code does, comments help jog our memory. Make sure your comments add value, if the function is called <code>a_plus_b</code> writing a comment like <code>// a plus b</code> does not add value, something like <code>// Returns the sum of a and b as an integer</code> is a lot more useful.
            </p>
