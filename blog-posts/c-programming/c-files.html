            <h1 class="blog-post-h1">Working with Files in C</h1>
            <p>
                Files! Files! Files! How many times a day do you work with a file? Whether it be a text file, Word document, or image, we deal with a types of 
                files daily. As a programmer it is important to know how to create files, access the data they contain or modify them. In this blog post we will 
                discuss how to work with plaintext files in C. We are going to look at how to create simple text files, read in text from them and modify them.
            <p>
            
            <h2 class="blog-post-h1">Opening/Creating Files</h2>
            <p>
                To open a file in C you need to use the function <code>fopen</code> from the Standard I/O library. <code>fopen(<em>address-to-file</em>, <em>atrribute</em>)</code> will open the file located 
                at the address you provided it, if the file does not exist it will create a new file for you. You can use the function with the following attributes:
             Creation of a new file (fopen with attributes as "a" or "a+" or "w" or "w+")
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"r" - Searches the file. If the file is opened successfully <code>fopen</code> loads it into memory and sets up a pointer which points to the first character in it. If the file cannot be opened fopen( ) returns NULL.</li>
                </li>"rb" - Open for reading in binary mode. If the file does not exist, <code>fopen</code> returns NULL.</li>
                <li>"w" - Searches the file. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. Returns NULL, if unable to open file.</li>
                <li>"wb" - Open for writing in binary mode. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</li>
                <li>"a" - Searches the file. If the file is opened successfully <code>fopen</code> loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the last character in it. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. Returns NULL, if unable to open file.</li>
                <li>"ab" - Open for append in binary mode. Data is added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</li>
                <li>"r+" - Searches the file. If is opened successfully <code>fopen</code> loads it into memory and sets up a pointer which points to the first character in it. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.</li>
                <li>"rb+" - Open for both reading and writing in binary mode. If the file does not exist, <code>fopen</code> returns NULL.</li>
                <li>"w+"" - Searches the file. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file doesn't exist a new file is created. Returns NULL, if unable to open file.</li>
                <li>"wb+"" - Open for both reading and writing in binary mode. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</li>
                <li>"a+"- Searches the file. If the file is opened successfully <code>fopen</code> loads it into memory and sets up a pointer which points to the last character in it. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. Returns NULL, if unable to open file.</li>
                <li>"ab+"" - Open for both reading and appending in binary mode. If the file does not exist, it will be created.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As given above, if you want to perform operations on a binary file, then you have to append 'b' at the last. For example, instead of "w", you have to use "wb", instead of "a+" you have to use "a+b". For performing the operations on the file, a special pointer called File pointer is used which is declared as:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    1 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
                    2 <br>
                    3 int main() { <br>
                    4 &nbsp; &nbsp; FILE *filePointer;<br>
                    5 &nbsp; &nbsp; // open the file for writing <br>
                    6 &nbsp; &nbsp; filePointer = fopen("file_name.txt", "w") <br>
                    7 &nbsp; &nbsp; return 0;<br>
                    8 }
                </code>
                <br><br>
                Ensure to select the correct atrribute for the action(s) you would like to do on the file. Note before I mentioned that you provide an address to the file, this is in 
                the case that the file you want to read or write to is in another folder. For example, if my C file is in the directory <em>program</em> and my file, <code>file_name.txt</code> is in 
                the folder <em>files</em> then you need to provide the string value <code>"files/file_name.txt"</code> not just <code>"file_name.txt"</code>. What if files is actually outside the <em>program</em> 
                directory then you have to use a <strong>".."</strong> to tell C to search for the file outside the folder so we would then say <code>"../files/file_name.txt"</code> rather. Use as many <strong>".."</strong> 
                as required to step back to the desired directory where the file is. The term file path is used to describe this.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h1">Reading from Files</h2>
            <p>
                The file read operations can be performed using functions <code>fscanf</code> or <code>fgets</code>. Both the functions performed the same operations as that of scanf and gets but with an additional parameter, the file pointer. So, it depends on you if you want to read the file line by line or character by character.
                And you can add the following lines to read data from the file:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    FILE * filePointer; 
                    <br><br>
                    filePointer = fopen("file_name.txt", "r"); // open the file for reading
                    <br><br>
                    fscanf(filePointer, "%s %s %s %d", str1, str2, str3, &year);
                </code>
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h1">Write from Files</h2>
            <p>
                Here we desire to add data to a given file. The file write operations can be performed by the functions <code>fprintf</code> and <code>fputs</code> with similarities to read operations. The snippet for writing to a file is as : 
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    FILE *filePointer ; 
                    <br><br>
                    filePointer = fopen("file_name.txt", "w");
                    <br><br>
                    fprintf(filePointer, "%s %s %s %d", "We", "are", "in", 2012);
                </code>
                <br><br>
                You will probably find it easier to work with with <code>fprintf</code> as it works like <code>printf</code> but now we are "printing" to a file instead of the screen.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h1">Releasing resources associated with working with a File</h2>
            <p>
                Once you are done with reading or writing to a file you need to release the associated resources and ensure modifications are saved by closing the file by using the <code>fopen</code> function e.g. <code>fclose(filePointer)</code>. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> You do this at the end of your program, it will saw errors if you do it earlier.
            </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-h1">Moving to a specific location in a File</h2>
            <p>
                This is not commmonly used as we tend to process entire files or produce entire files from scratch but it can be useful to move to a specific location in a file. The functions 
                <code>fseek</code> and <code>rewind</code> can be used for this. You may see programs that access Random Access Files using such operations.
            </p>
