            <h1 class="blog-post-h1">Duality: The dual of the primal problem</h1>
        <p>
            Associated with any LP is another LP, called the <strong>dual</strong>. This relation is important because it gives us interesting economic insights. Knowledge of duality will also provide additional insights into Sensitivity analysis.
            <br><br>
            If we say the primal LP gives us the quantities of goods, we can think of the dual LP giving us the price of the goods.
            <br><br>
            Let's take a look at an example, given the following LP(primal LP):
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  max \(16x_1 + 10x_2 \)
            <br><br>
            such that:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(2x_1 + 2x_2 \le 8 \)<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \(2x_1 + x_2 \le 6 \)<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \(x_1, x_2 \ge 0 \)
            <br><br>
            It's dual can be expressed as:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  min \(8y_1 + 6y_2 \)
            <br><br>
            such that:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(2y_1 + 2y_2 \ge 16 \)<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \(2y_1 + y_2 \ge 6 \)<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \(y_1, y_2 \ge 0 \)
            <br><br>
            Hence we have for,
            <br><br>
            Primal, max \(cx \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; => &nbsp; &nbsp; Dual, min \(yb \)<br>
                    such that \(Ax \le b \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;such that \(yA \ge c \)<br>
                    \(x \ge 0 \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(y \ge 0 \)<br>
            <br><br>
            Or,
            <br><br>
            Primal, min \(cx \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; => &nbsp; &nbsp; Dual, max \(yb \)<br>
            such that \(Ax \ge b \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;such that \(yA \le c \)<br>
            \(x \ge 0 \) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(y \ge 0 \)<br>
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-h2">Important Theorems and Derivations</h2>
        <p>
            Note: <strong>P</strong> = primal problem, <strong>D</strong> = dual of the primal problem
            <br><br>
            (1) The dual of the dual is the primal.
            <br><br>
            (2) Let \(x\) be a solution of (P), a maximising problem, and let \(y\) be a solution for (D), a minimising problem, them \(cx \le yb\).
            <br><br>
            (3) If the primal objective function is unbounded, the dual doesn't have any feasible solutions.
            <br><br>
            (4) If the dual objective function is unbounded, the primal doesn't have any feasible solutions.
            <br><br>
            (5) If the primal doesn't have any feasible solutions, the dual doesn't have any feasible solutions or it is unbounded.
            <br><br>
            (6) If the dual doesn't have any feasible solutions, the primal doesn't have any feasible solutions or it is unbounded.
            <br><br>
            (7) Optimality in primal <=> in dual.
            <br><br>
            (8) If \(x\) is a solution for (P), \(y\) is solution for (D), and \(cx = yb\), then \(x\) is optimal solution for (P) and \(y\) is the optimal solution for (D).
            <br><br>
            (9) If (P) has a feasible solution and (D) has a feasible solution, then both the primal and dual have an optimal solution and their objective function values are the same.
            <br><br>
            (10) <strong>Complementary Slackness</strong>: Consider \((P^*)\) and \((D^*)\) in the standard form above. Let \((x^*, \mu^*)\) be a solution for \((P^*)\) and let \((y^*, \lambda^*)\) be a solution for \((D^*)\). Then \((x^*, \mu^*)\) is optimal for \(P^*\) and \((y^*, \lambda^*)\) is optimal for \(D^*\) provided that \(y^*\mu^* + x^*\lambda^* = 0\).
        </p>

        <p>
            A popular way to think about Duality is that the Primal problem relates to maximising the number of items that can be packed into a knapsack, while the Dual relates to minimising the open space.
